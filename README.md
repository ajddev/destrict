What is Destrict?
-----------------

Destrict is an open social network concept for immutably storing and creating posts.

Destrict makes it possible to connect with peers and create, share, and store unalterable information.

Destrict is designed to preserve freedom of speech and expression.

So, it's like Twitter/Facebook?
-------------------------------

Destrict is an experimental social media interpreter that enables censorship-resistant networking for anyone, anywhere in the world. In it's current form, Destrict accesses and uses data stored on the Stellar Blockchain, which incorporates the following differences over conventional social networking sites:

Destrict posts live permanently, guaranteed.
Data on the blockchain will be accessible forever.
There is no censorship and deleting old posts is an impossibility.

Logging in to a Destrict is like building your own social media site from scratch on your local machine. 

What do I do on Destrict?
-------------------------

Destricts will never be able to have an edit button and posts cannot be altered after posting. With immutability comes accountability- there are no take backs, so be mindful, and think thrice.

While the Destrict concept can theoretically be built on any timechain, currently the Stellar decentralized protocol is used. Stellar is fast, and transactions cost fractions of a penny.

You do not need to provide any information to start a Destrict. The Destrict sign up process is one-click.
The testnet is free-to-use. You don't have to own any cryptocurrency, but you should own some Bitcoin.
